# 🤖 Gemini AI Chatbot (Python)

A simple AI-powered chatbot built using Python and Google Gemini API.  
This chatbot works in the terminal and can answer any type of question —
from normal conversation to coding help, study topics, explanations, jokes, etc.

This project is part of my personal learning + college submission.
